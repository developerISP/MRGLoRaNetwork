# The Col Margherita LoRa Project (ROSY: Remote Observatory SYstem)
This is the repository for the school-work project between the Istitute of Polar Science ISP-CNR of Venice and the ITIS Max Planck of Villorba (TV)

# Who
The wonderful people involved in the ROSY project are all students, as they will never stop to learn! 

The young team in electronics, computer science, power management that built up the work is:
Nicolò Baseggio,
Davide Dal Bo,
Andrea De Marchi,
Michele Ferrarese,
Massimiliano Granziol,
Marco Martini,
Silvia Mondin,
Federico Peruzzo,
Roberto Pomiato,
Nicolò Rasera,
Nicola Voltarel

The group is trained and motivated by selfless and great teachers:
Alessandro Rocco Monteduro,
Monica Disarò,
Eugenio Rossi,
Giorgio Damian

The project is coordinated by enthusiastic researchers:
Federico Dallo,
Daniele Zannoni,
Fabrizio De Blasi,
Jacopo Gabrieli,
Carlo Barbante

# When
The project started in January 2020, continued throughout the tough Covid-19 pandemic thanks to the great motivation of the students and is on its way to be completed during the spring 2021. We were able to continue the development of hardware and software thanks to the distance learing (DAD) and tele-work. We have met at the ITIS Max Planck laboratories to build up the instrumentations and to perform several test, such as measuring the power comsumption and telecommunication capabilieties of the instruments. We were hosted at the Ca' Foscari University Campus in Via Torino and at the National Research Council (CNR) Col Margherita Observatory in the Belluno province.

# How

# Why

# Network
Files related to the acquisition, communication and ... are organized in the "network" directory. 

# Meteorology
Files for the analysis of meteorological variables are organized in the "meteorology" directory.
